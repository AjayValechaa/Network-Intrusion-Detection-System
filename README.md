# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
We developed a Network Intrusion Detection System using supervised and unsupervised data mining models for classification. The dataset used is network_traffic.csv. We performed exploratory data analysis and multiple factor analysis to understand the nature and patterns in intrusions. After exploration, we decided to use 4 models that work well for binary classification. We used Logistic Regression, KNN,Decision Trees and Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine. After building our models we evaluated the models using confusion matrix and ROC/AUC plots. In the end we present out findings and the model bank should choose for intrusion detection.
